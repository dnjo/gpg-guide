# GPG and git guide

## Introduction
This guide mainly focuses on using GPG together with git and and services such as GitHub and GitLab from the perspective of a developer. It is therefore fairly practical and does not cover the various security concepts that is used by GPG.

The main benefits of using GPG:
- I can certify that I have made a certain change by signing my git commits.
- I can authenticate myself towards services using SSH.

### YubiKeys and GPG
The keys generated by this guide can be transferred and used on YubiKeys. See drduh's guide on that topic: https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide.

From the guide:
> Keys stored on YubiKey are non-exportable (as opposed to file-based keys that are stored on disk) and are convenient for everyday use. Instead of having to remember and enter passphrases to unlock SSH/GPG keys, YubiKey needs only a physical touch after being unlocked with a PIN. All signing and encryption operations happen on the card, rather than in OS memory.

### Scope
This will mainly be aimed at MacOS users since that is what I use myself.
